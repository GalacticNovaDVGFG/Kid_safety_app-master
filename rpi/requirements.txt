# Requirements for the Raspberry Pi companion (used by rpi/app.py)
# Install these into your project virtualenv (pip) on development machines, or prefer apt packages on Raspberry Pi for some items.

# gpiozero provides GPIO button support. On Raspberry Pi prefer the OS package(s): python3-gpiozero python3-rpi.gpio
# If you need it in a virtualenv you can also install via pip:
# pip install gpiozero
gpiozero

# OpenCV: pip 'opencv-python-headless' may build from source on ARM and require many build deps.
# On Raspberry Pi 4 it's recommended to install system OpenCV via apt: sudo apt install -y python3-opencv
opencv-python-headless

# Picamera2 is optional and Raspberry Pi–specific. It is typically installed via apt on Raspberry Pi OS:
#   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2 libcamera-apps
# If a pip wheel is available you can try 'pip install picamera2', but apt is the recommended path on Pi.
# (This package is not required for USB webcams or OpenCV capture.)
