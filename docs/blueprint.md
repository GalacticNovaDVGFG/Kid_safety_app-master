# **App Name**: Guardian Keychain

## Core Features:

- Live Video Call: Initiate a live video call to a pre-defined contact (parent/guardian) using the RPi camera. The call will provide the parents with a 360 view.
- One-Touch Activation: Simple, single-button activation to immediately start the video call for ease of use in distress situations.
- Location Sharing: Automatically share the device's current location with the contact during the video call.
- Image Recognition (panic detection): The device analyzes the video to detect possible dangers and act as a 'tool' that decides whether it needs to take a screenshot, or initiate recording based on perceived panic level, or to share alerts with authorities. Possible dangers can be pre-trained.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, reassuring blue (#64B5F6), symbolizing trust and security.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD), creating a calm, non-intrusive feel.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FFB74D), used for the call button to ensure it's easily identifiable.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for the primary labels and UI, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for subtitles.
- Simple, clear icons for settings, location, and emergency functions, designed for quick recognition. Consider outlines and a 2px stroke weight for clarity on a small display.
- Minimalist layout focusing on the call activation button. Important information such as location is discreetly displayed.
- Subtle, reassuring animations when initiating or ending a call.
